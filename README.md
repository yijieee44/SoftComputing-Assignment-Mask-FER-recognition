# SoftComputing-Assignment-Mask-FER-recognition

Detecting oneâ€™s emotion through their face expression is what we normally do when we are communicating with others. However, it is harder for us to detect it in this Covid-19 pandemic as a face mask covered half of the face which includes nose and mouth. 

In this project, the model is trained to categorizes facial expression of people who wearing a face mask into three categories which are negative, neutral and positive. A pretrained model, mobilenet_v3_small is used. The dataset used in this project is LFW-Emotion dataset by KDDI researcher. Below is the GitHub link to the dataset:
